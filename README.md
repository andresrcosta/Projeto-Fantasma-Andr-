# Data alysis for Barbie's clothes shopping

## Description

This repository documents my participation in the selection process for the junior company Estat. The process consisted of weeks of activities in the Marketing, Commercial, Projects, and Management departments, along with the completion of a Ghost Project. The Ghost Project involved analyzing a fictitious database from a Barbie clothes store. This database contained detailed information about products sold, including brands, sizes, prices, categories, and reasons for returns.
## Motivation

The primary goal was to apply the statistical techniques acquired during my Bachelor's in Statistics at the University of Bras√≠lia, while also striving to translate these statistical findings into a format understandable for individuals unfamiliar with statistics.

## Technological Framework

Software RSTUDIO 4.3.2
