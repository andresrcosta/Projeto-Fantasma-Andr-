# Data alysis for Barbie's clothes shopping

## Description

This repository documents my participation in the selection process for the junior company Estat. The process consisted of weeks of activities in the Marketing, Commercial, Projects, and Management departments, along with the completion of a Ghost Project. The Ghost Project involved analyzing a fictitious database from a Barbie clothes store. This database contained detailed information about products sold, including brands, sizes, prices, categories, and reasons for returns. The primary goal was to apply the statistical techniques learned during my Bachelor's in Statistics at the University of Brasília. This report reflects my work and analysis carried out during the selection process.
